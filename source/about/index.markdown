# About Me
{% img http://seanbw.com/images/about_me.jpg %}

My name is Sean Bowen-Williams, and I'm a Maryland native trapped in Chicago.
I work as a Software Engineer making Rails apps. I enjoy test driven development, reading POODR, and bickering over Agile ticket point scales. I'm a life-long dog enthusiast.
